  SDK app Code template:           refer: add-on-app template repo
   -------------
   
 ->  sdk framework asks app developers to write code in aspecific way so that it can understand so that it can and package the code in right way
 
 eg: spring framework 
 
 -> riversand sdk framework  defined a code template which app developers should follow to develop apps:
 
 
 --------------
 
 the main structure of sdk are:
 
 batch/job_defs
 resources
 source
 application.json
 version.properties:
 
 -> application.json: these is place where you define id of your app:
 
 -> versionproperties: gieves the version of app
 
 
 *** job_def folder name sholud be same as of jobdef id:
 job_defs: is the main requirement sdk framework look for packaging.
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ** we have git repo dataplatform-apps-sdk which is sdk app template which helps us to package all our code 
        -> which has shell scripts helps us to package our code using job_defs
        
        
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        
      In  job_defs folder we have something called triggers:
        
        
        Triggers:
        --------
        
        -> triggers helps us how we want to invoke your job defination in your app:
        
        4 types of triigers:
        
          -> eventgrid trigger
          -> rest trigger
          -> schedule recurring  trigger : schedule.json
          -> schedule one time trigger
          
          
   EventGridTrigger: 
       -> when ever a xml gets uploaded into vendoruploadcontainer I need this job should be triggerd
          -> blob watcher trigger
              
       
   RestTrigger: 
   
      -> we can have it as a rest call
      -> where we can specify the appid and job_def
      -> which inturn triggers our application
      
      -> proxyservice in rdf a service which takes care our rest call 
      
 ***      api/proxyservice/call:
      
      
      *** 
       -> there are four sdk app functions which you can find in azure portal:
       
             1. base_eventgrid_trigger :   is a blobwatcher trigger
             2. batch_rest_trigget
             3.schedule_batch_rest_trigger
       
         
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
             resources folder:
             ------------
             
             
             -> has the json files which help in creating resources on the azure while deployment:
             
                   containers/ tables
             
                    -> like creating vendor container:
                    etc
             
 
 -> if the resources are already there in storage account then this step will be skipped:
