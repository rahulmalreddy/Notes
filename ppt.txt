   Entity level permissions:

In the authorization data model for intended user role we can set the
permission say read permission whch allows user to only read the etity.

Step:

-> go to role and user authorization app
> download authoriation data model template
-> we can give permissions to different role for entity in Base permissions page
-> 

Permissioms at attribute level:

-> we can set the permissions at attribute level for different type of entities
   
Step 1:

-> go to role and user authorisation app

-> download authorization data model

-> In the data model template: 
  -> we have variuos roes such as vendor, supplier, business admin, content enricher
     etc.
  -> and users have roles assigned to them (mapped to them)
  -> it is possible to assign multiple roles to one user

** by default every user will have read,write and modify options

-> but we can customize it in EARC Permissions

-> after completing upload it to to platform and the changes like permissios
   will be live


            Exclusive:
          ----------------

Set permission at domain level:

-> in exclusive we can even set authorization at domain level:

-> this can be done by setting permissions in base page in the data model template

-> 

Set permission at entity level:

Set permission at attribute level:

-> we can give only read permission at attribute level even though the user is 
   given edit and delete permission at entity level
  
-> by giving RW at entity 
-> and by yes and no no in attribute level


Hide entity type:

-> when the admin leaves the permission columns blank  at entity then the
   user role , cannot view the entoty 



Set Context level permission:

--> we can even set the permissiona t context level 
-> In base permission worksheet set contexttype and contecxt name and
     give permission for role
-> and in Earc worksheet map the attribute with context name and type 


Ownership data permission

-> if detemines entity ownership is set to yes then it will not allow any
   other vendors to look at the data.

-> if ownership edit data is set to yes it will not allow any other vendors to 
   edit data.
