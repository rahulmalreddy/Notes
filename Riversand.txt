Base Data Model:

Refernce data Model:
---------------------

















Ascend:   Data Modelling:
------------------------

Entity: Entity are things which are mastered in rp

eg:   item
      Bundle
      customer
      vendor

Attributes: properties describing variuos enties or relationships
 
Eg:  
Customer:   customerid, name, billing address, shippingid


Relationships: are links between two differnt entity types

Eg: 1.  bundle contains shirt and jeans
    2. is child of   : parentitem ------------> item
                                   is child of
    3. has images
    4. frequently brought together


EAR Mapping: 

-> EAR allows u to map entites with attributes and relationships
-> attributes to relationships known as relationship based attributes
-------------------
-> riversand supports 7 entity types by default


1. Entity :
 Eg: item, bundle, customer, vendor item.

2. Attributes:
-> consider a shirt entity has various attributes i.e color, size, description
   brand etc.

3. Relationships:
  -> the link between two differnt entity types:


Attribute data types:
------------------------
Datatype                Display type              validations 

1. String -------  textbox/textarea/rich text     minlength/maxlength/multi values

2.Decimal            TectBox                      rangefrom/rangeto/precision                
                      20.25 

3.integer

4.boolean           dropdown

5. date

6.date time

7. list of values

Master Data Management:
------------------------

MasterData: Master data represent people,places or things that an organization . //nouns

Transaction Data: represents the evnet in which the master data participates in.  //verbs

-> transaction data will be highly volataile
-> master data will be consistent.

** the goal of MDM is to provide synchronization to the most critical pieces of information stored in 
   different locations in company.
Step 1: provides a focal point which is Master Data.
Step 2: produce the plumming to synchronize the data between the master data and different data pieces
Step 3: Data quality // to assure the data getting synchronized is correct.

Riversand Platform overview:
 ---------------------------

-> riversand is a Saas based platform.
-> riversand mdm is used to manage complete information lifecycle of an item. 
   dataonboarding --> management ---> syndicate

       Data governance:

-> data governance is sued to ensure required information is 
   avalable and accurate
-> is of two types:

1. process ---> workflows and business functions

2. Data -----> data model level constraints/rules
               business rules
               business conditions
               workflow related rules

Workflow:
 -> helps stream line and automate repeatable business tasks,
    minimmizing room for errors
-> is a sequence of actioons and conditions defining a business
   process
-> is also a series of stages an entity goes through to
   achieve the final process or result


Busines function:
-> provides a sequential guided approach to perform a task
-> helps users to navigate the process correctly and provide
mandatory attributes and relationship information
-> provides info to the user abut the stage at which the 
   entity is in the process

data model:
-> determines the structure of all data objects(or entities)
 of the organization and ensures that they are represented 
  accurately
-> determines how data can be stored and accessed
-> data governence at data model u ca specify certain rules
  and constraints

Business Condition:
-> logical condition

RBL:

syntax: IIF(boolean_Excpression, true_value, false_value)

Keywords:
----------
-> Native : 
-> core: to build business rules
       
-> govern service keyword:
-> post process kwywords:
-> content genration keywords


Data Govenanace: 
-----------------

-> drive smarter decision making
-> accuracy and completness of info
-> dynamic data governance
-> adv entity intospection

three types;
-> data model level rules
-> adv brs for computation and validation
->workflow related rules

same as above governace concepts

entity goes through entity process while created , updated

governace model:
----------------
-> business rules
-> business conditions
-> governance context
-. governance mapping

   Workflow and business process:
-----------------------------------

5 types of workflow actions: computation and validation
  Exit criteria: this action ensures workflow cannot exit 
                  until it satisfies one or more business 
                   conditions
  skip criteria:is used to skip a step of workflow if it satisfies
                 oone or mode BC
  activity entry:this action is used to execute BR and BC when
                  entity enters the step
  activity exit : execute br and bc when an entity exits a step

 resume: this option is used to automatically trigger a workflow
          transition
         
Steps:

   Step1:
   Step 2:  create business rule
   step 3: Map BR with Business Condition
   Step 4: create workflow context
   step 5: create governance mapping

Exit Criteria:
-------------
  cannot exit a workflow unless BR or Bc satisfies:

Skip Criteria:
--------------
   whwen all the Br and Bc are satisfied

--------------------------------------------------------------
     Data Vizualization and Reporting:
    --------------------------------------

Entity summary Reports:
---------------
-> the repor dispalys all the entities tht are distributed across entities types
-> we can add filter according to entity type, relationship etc
Widgets:
-> enity types: describes all the entity types
-> Hierarchy Details: No of entity types available in each hierarchy
-> context:
-> relationships:
-> created users:
-> modified users:
-> Entity List : displays all the entties of entity type.

Data Quality Report:
--------------------
-> allows us to view entites based on various business conditions
Widgets:
-> Total Business rule failure
-> Rule type
-> Attribute view of errors
-> entity type
-> BC
-> Govern Entity list

Workflow SLA Report:
-------------------
-> displays the analysis of entity workflow in realworld

Trend Report:
--------------
-. displayed to only system admin
-> enables us to analyse the trend of data complienece and 
 export entites for give period of timee
