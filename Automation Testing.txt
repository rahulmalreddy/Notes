                Automation Testing: 
               ----------------------

-> selenium is a suite of software tools to automate web browsers.
-> it is open source and mai ly used for functional testing and regression testing.

Locators: locators can be termed as a address that identifies a web element uniquely
          identfies a web element uniquely within a web page.

Types of Locators:

1. Id
2. Name
3. LinkText
4. Css Selector
5. partial link text
6. Xpath. //tagname[@Attribute = 'value']



               Selenium Grid:
           -------------------

-> allows us to execute test script on differnt machines at the same time.

-> execution is possible on
      1. Different machines with differnt browsers
      2. same browsers but different versions

-> it saves a lot of time and effort for execution

-> it consists of hub and multiple nodes
     1. hub works as central point cotrolling all the nodes
     2. nodes are actual machines on whicg execution is done

Hub:
-----
-> central point where you load your tests
-> only one hub in a grid
-> loads only on a single machine

Nodes:
------------
-> selenium instances that will execeutes the tests
-> one or more nodes in a grid
-> launched on multiple machines with different platform and differnt versions


Starting the hub:
--------------------

-> have your selenium server satandalone.jar at the same location in all the systems


Run the command in terminal:

hub:
-------

java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.3.3jar -role hub

nodes:
--------
 
java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.3.3jar -role node -hub https:// -- register  

Step 2: to register node to hubs

java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver-location of driver -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.3.3jar -role node -hub https:// -- register 

-> we have switch off firewall for grid to work.
