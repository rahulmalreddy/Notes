1. what is diff b/w JVM, JRE, JDK ?
 
 JVM: Jvm is an abstract machine , it provides runtime environment in which bytecode is 
      executed

JRE : Java RunTime Envuironment: is a runtime environment which implements JVM and provides 
      class libraries and other files that jvm uses at runtime.

    - > It is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications.

JDK : JDK is necessary to compile, document, and package java programs.
    -> The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to
    develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. 
   -> It contains JRE + development tools.
-------------------------------------------------------------
2.Synchronization?

 -> Synchronization is a process which keeps all the concurrent threads in execution
    to be in sync

-> It avoids memory consistency errors

** -> Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads 
      to any shared resource
------------------------------------------------------------
3. What is Process and thread?

-> The process can be referred as program in execution where thread is part of process

-> process has its own address space and multiple thread share same addres space of 
   space .Each aaddress has its own stack.

-> Thread is the smallest unit which can execute concurrently with other threads.

->process are heavyweight and threads are lightweight

-> You do not require synchronization in case of process. Threads require synchronization   

-> Process do not depend on each other whereas threads are not independent as they
    share address space.



-------------------------------------------------------------
4. What are wrapper classes?

-> eight primitive data types has each class dedicated to it. known as wrapper class
-> this class wrap the primitive data types into objects.

datatype     wrapperclass   constructor
boolean   -> Boolean   -> boolean/String
-----------------------------------------------------------
5. What is final, finally, finalize?

final:  Keyword
-> Final is used to apply restrications on class methods and variables
-> final variable cant be modified method cant be override and class cant be inherited.

finally ; -> bloc
 -> finally is used to place important code 
 -> It is executed even though no exception occurs

finalize: -> Method.

-> whenever an object is removed from memory by garbage collector finialize method is 
   executed
-> It is used to perform clean up processing.
------------------------------------------------------------

6. Diff between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

-> both are mutable objects

-> StringBuffer : 1. Synchronized
                  2. thread safe

-> StringBuilder: 1. Not Synchronized
                  2. Performance is faster 
------------------------------------------------------------------
7. What are diff between Stack and heap memory

Heapmemory: Java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects and 
            JRE classes. 
            ->  Whenever we create an object, it’s always created in the Heap space.

1. Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application 
2. Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space 
   and stack memory contains the reference to it.
3. Objects stored in the heap are globally accessible
4. Heap memory is divided into Young-Generation, Old-Generation etc, more details at 


Stack memory : Java Stack memory is used for the execution of a thread


1. whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.
2. Stack memory only contains local primitive variables and 
    reference variables to objects in heap space.
3. stack memory can’t be accessed by other threads.
4. Memory management in stack is done in LIFO manner 

-------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Garbage Collection?

-> Java garbage collection is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory 
   management

-> Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, 
    When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, 

-> Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed. The garbage collector finds
   these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Diff between ArrayLsiat and Vector?

ArrayList:
-> ArrayList is not Synchronised
-> arratList is fast as it is not synchronied
-> It increases its size by 50%
-> Array list can use iterator for traversing an ArrayLsit

Vector: 
-> it is synchronized
-> It is slower
-> doubling size of its array
-> Vector uses both Enumeration and Iterator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.Difference between Abstract Class and interface:

Abstract:
-> Abstarct class can have abstarct methods and default method
-> Abstarct class can extend only one abstarct class
-> Abstarct class can contain constructors
-> abstarct class are fast


Interface:
-> Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction
->interface cannot contain constructors
-> Interface consist only anstract methods

-> a class can achieve multiple inheritence by interface

-> -> methods in interface are default public abstract
       i.e public abstract method();
-> Interfaces are slow
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. What is ploymorphism?

-> It can be briefly  described as one interface and many implementations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Runtime Polymorphism / Dynamic method dispatch?

->Method overriding is one of the ways in which java suppoerts run time polymoephism.

-> Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method 
   is resolved at run time, rather than compile time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. Method overloading and method overriding


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14.Can you override a private or static method  in java?

-> A private method cannot be overriden because it is not visible to another class

->But If you create a method with same method name, return type and same method arguments 
  in the child class then it wil hide the parent class. this is known as method hiding.

 Can we override ststic method in java?

 -> the answer is no and yes.

  1.We can overload static methods. But remember that the method signature must be
    different. i.e arguments passing or return type or number  of arguments etc

  2.he answer is No. We cannot override two methods if they differ only by static keyword. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. What is multiple inheritence and does java support it?

-> If a child class inherits the properties from multiple classes is known as multiple
   inheritence

-> the problem with multiple inheritence is that if that if multiple classes has same method
   name then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method 
   to execute.
-
-> The reason behind this is to prevent ambiguity. Consider a case where class B extends 
   class A and Class C and both class A and C have the same method display(). Now java 
   compiler cannot decide, which display method it should inherit. To prevent such
   situation, multiple inheritances is not allowed in java

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. What is Break and continue?

Break: Break statement mainly used to terminate the enclosing loop such as while, do-while,
       for or switch statement wherever break is declared.

Continue: Continue statement mainly skip the rest of loop wherever continue is declared
         and execute the next iteration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. What is Servlet?

-> Servlets are used to create dynamic web pages
-> they reside at server side and generate dynamic web pages.
-> Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create a dynamic web page.
-> Servlet is an interface that must be implemented for creating any Servlet.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18. what is diff between Get and post Methods.

-> Get and Post method are http requests.

Get:
->  In case of Get request, only limited amount of data can be sent because 
   data is sent in header.
-> Get request is not secured because data is exposed in URL bar.

Post:
-> In case of post request, large amount of data can be sent because data is sent in body.
-> Post request is secured because data is not exposed in URL bar.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. what is session management?/ different methods of session management?

*  Http protocol and web servers are stateless i.e every request is new request  for process
  and they cant identify where is it coming from so. session management comes into
 play.

-> Since http and server are both stateless the only way to maintain a session 
is when some unique information about the session (Session id) is passed between server 
 and client for every request and response
-> so we can send datat from one servlet to another by session management.

There are several ways through which we can provide unique identifier in 
 request and response.
1. User Authentication
2.URL Rewriting 
3. Cookies 
4.Session Management API 
5.HTML Hidden Field 
6. User Authentication
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. what is diff between servlet config and servlet contxt?

servlet congig:
-> servlet config object represts  only single servelt.
-> It is like local parameter asscoiated with particular servlet
-> it has servlet wide scope. It is name value pair defined inside servlet section in 
   web.xml file.
-> getservletConfig() is used to get coonfig object.

Servlet Context:
-> It represts whole web application running on jvm.
-> it is like global paramameter associated with all servlets.
-> It has application wide scope.so defiend outside servlet tag in web.xml file.

--------------------------------------------------------

21. what is servlet life cycle.

-> It has 5 stages;
1. Servlet is loaded
2. Servlet is instanited
3.  Servlet is initalization
4. request / service method is invoked.
5. Destruction/   destroy method is invoked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22. What is RequestDispatcher?

-> Request Dispatcher is an interface is used to forward the request to another resource
  that can be html, jsp or anothe rservlet.
-> we can also include the content of anothe rresource to the respose

methods. void forward().
          void incude();
--------------------------------------------------------------------
23. How does cookies work in servlet?

-> Cookies are data that is stored in client browser

-> when browser makes a new request the cookies are added to request default and send to 
   server whch helps o determine the user as old user.
Two types of cookies:

Non-persistent cookie
It is valid for single session only. It is removed each time when user closes the browser.

Persistent cookie
It is valid for multiple session . It is not removed each time when user closes the browser.
 It is removed only if user logout or signout.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. what is jdbc Driver?

-> jdbc driver is a software componet that enables java application to interact wth database 

4 types:

1. jdbc-odbc bridge
2. native api driver(partially java driver)
3. network protocol driver(fully java driver)
4 thin driver (fully java driver)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25 . steps to connect to databse

1. regestaring the driver class
2. creting connection
3. creating statement
4. executig queries
5. closing connections
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. What is clob and blob? 

 BLOB stands for binary large objects, which are used for storing binary data, such as an image. ... 
CLOB stands for character large objects, which are used to store string data too large
 to be stored in a VARCHAR column.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27 . What are different jdbc api components?

interfaces:
1. connection 
2. statemnet
3. prepared statement
4. resultset
4.resultsetmetadata
5.databasemetsdata
6.callable statement

classes:
1. drivermanager
2.clob
3.blob
4.sql exception
5.types.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. What is connection interface?

-> the connection interface maintains a session with the databse.it is used for 
   transaction management

1) public Statement createStatement(): creates a statement object that can be used to 
                                       execute SQL queries.

2) public Statement createStatement(int resultSetType,int resultSetConcurrency): Creates 
a Statement object that will generate ResultSet objects with the given type and concurrency.

3) public void setAutoCommit(boolean status): is used to set the commit status.By default 
it is true.

4) public void commit(): saves the changes made since the previous commit/rollback
 permanent.

5) public void rollback(): Drops all changes made since the previous commit/rollback.

6) public void close(): closes the connection and Releases a JDBC resources immediately.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. What is executeQuery(), executeUpdate(), execute();

-> executeQuery() is used to execute sql queries which returns sone data
 i.e select statement

-> execeuteupdate() : is used to execute queries which updates or modify the databases

-> execute() ; When we dont know what is the query;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

30.What is spring?

-> Spring is an application framework and inversion of control container for java platform.
-> Spring is alightweight framework.
-> it can be thought of as a framework of frameworks because it provides support to various
    frameworks such as Struts, Hibernate, Tapestry, EJB, JSF, etc.
-> Spring is essentially a lightweight integrated framwork used to develop
   enterprsie applications in java

-> * The Spring framework comprises several modules such as IOC, AOP, jdbc
  DAO, Context, ORM, WEB MVC etc. We will learn these modules in next page. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

31. What are important annotaions in spring frame work?

1. @autowired
2. @qualifier
3. @Resource
4. @postconstruct
5. @preDestroy
6. @required
  
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

32.What is bean in spring and expain diffrent scopes of bean?

-> The objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by
  the Spring IoC container are called beans.       

-> A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and 
   otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container  

Scopes of bean: 5
1. Singleton
2. Prototype
3. request
4. session
5. global session   

--------------------------------------------------------------------
33. How is bean added to spring application

by using beans tag in xml file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
34. What is diff between constructor injection and settor injection?

Constructor injection:
1. no partial injection
2. Doesnt override setter property
3. creates new instance if any modification occurs
4. better for to many properties

Setter injection:
1. partial injection
2. overrides constructor if both are defined
3. doesnt create new instance
4. bettr for some properties

----------------------------------------------------------------
