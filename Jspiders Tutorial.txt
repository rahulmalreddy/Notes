                    SDLC TYPES:

1. HYBRID MODEL:

-> combination of two models is called as hybrid model.
-> The various combinations under hybrid model are 
   1. v and prototype.
       -> Some time the customer is new to the softwaere as well as the project is  
          huge and complex.In such case we go for this combination.
      
       -> Prototype phase is added in between srs and hld in v model.

   2. Spiral and prototype:
           -> Modules are dependent and customer is new to the software  we go for this
              hybrid model.
           -> In between requirements and design we add prototype but only in the  
              first cycle.

Note: Waterfall model cannot be a part of hybrid model since in waterfall model in betwwen 
      requirement changes are not allowed.
